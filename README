This PAM module switches the execution context of the calling process
to a running OpenVZ container, like the "vzctl enter" command.
It is tipically used by a daemon like ssh or cron running in the 
Host Node to transparently run itself and its child processes in a 
container.
It is not supposed to be used with "standard" OpenVZ installations:
the system must be designed to share some components between the HN
and the affected contexts.

To use this module you need to add a line like this to the PAM
configuration file of the relevant daemon:

session required pam_vz.so

Then the daemon will enter the context with the CTID set to the UID or
GID of the user.

Beware: the module cannot be used with su(1) and interactive sessions,
because the stdin/stdout/stderr file descriptors of the process will
still be the ones in the HN.
It also cannot work with FTP servers because they will try to open the
data connections using the context IP address instead of the HN one.

Valid options for the module are:

* debug
Enables verbose logging.

* min_id=NUMBER
* max_id=NUMBER
Define the inclusive range of UIDs/GIDs which will cause entering the
associated context.
Default: min_id=10000, max_id=65533

* use_as_ctid=[uid|gid]
Chooses to use either the UID or the GID as the CTID.
Default: use_as_ctid=uid

* ctid_delta=number
Adds or subtracts a number from the CTID.
Default: ctid_delta=0

* closelog
Closes the syslog socket after entering the CT.
This will break logging unless a syslog daemon is running in the CT.
